## Testing

### What is the importance of unit testing?

Unit tests are important for ensuring the correctness, accuracy, and validity of a unit of source code's behavior. They allow bugs to be found earlier in the development cycle and facilitate the discovery of issues in regression and integration cycles. Moreover, unit tests serves as documentation and encourages design to adhere to specifications.


### When do you create and modify unit tests?

Depending on the testing methodology you subscribe to, unit tests may be created at different stages of the development cycle. Testing should be not thought of as an afterthought, however, but an integral part of the development process and so should be created as early as possible. In test driven development, tests are created before the functionality has even been implemented. This allows the implementer to focus on the what rather than the how and allows the tests to drive the criteria for success. Unit tests should modified whenever functionality is added, modified, or removed that impacts the unit of source code's behavior.
